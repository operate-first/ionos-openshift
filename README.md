# Mission Statement

## Establish an IONOS HV on Operate First as a community project
Started at and based on the Kick-Off Meeting 2022-03-16.

### Deploying IONOS HV with Operate First.

## Goals:

- Building a community approach
- Establishing communication (patterns) between IONOS & Red Hat
- Finding best practices for IONOS HV on Operate First & OpenShift
- Having a proof of concept and blue print for future projects

## Participants

### IONOS
IONOS is the leading European provider of hosting services, cloud services and cloud infrastructure.

### Red Hat
Red Hat is the world's enterprise open source leader.

### Operate First
While open source has made software widely available, it has also exposed another barrier to entry: the ability to operate software in production. Proprietary services for operations undermine the open source model, so we must now shift our focus to open sourcing operations.

In doing so, developers and operators collaborate to apply a projectâ€™s operational considerations right back into the code. The result?

Better code, better performance, better final product.


## Set up and environment
### Data Center Designer (DCD)
The Data Center Designer (DCD) is a unique tool for creating and managing your DCD's graphical user interface makes data center configuration intuitive and straightforward. You can drag-and-drop virtual elements to set up and configure data center infrastructure components. 
As is the case with a physical data center, you can use the DCD to connect various virtual elements to create a complete hosting infrastructure. 
An introduction to the DCD can be found [here](https://youtu.be/SSuEnGU7hJc).
